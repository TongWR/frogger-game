Frogger
===============================
This is a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger.

## How to Load Game
Simply download the whole folder and open index.html in any modern browser to play.

## How to Play
Your objective is to get to the water without colliding with any of the bugs.
Once you reaches, you level up. Congrats!

### But not so fast...
Every time you level up, the game gets a little harder.
The bugs either move faster or multiply!

Enjoy \*evil laugh\*
